Yammer defines engagement as having made some type of server call by interacting with the product (shown in the data as events of type "engagement"). Any point in this chart can be interpreted as "the number of users who logged at least one engagement event during the week starting on that date."

You are responsible for determining what caused the dip at the end of the chart shown above and, if appropriate, recommending solutions for the problem.
